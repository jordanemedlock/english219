  <h2>Introduction
  <p>
    I want anyone to be able to use this tutorial, but I don't intend for anyone to leave this with all the knowledge of a CS degree.
    I am hoping, however, that you may consider solving future problems using a little bit of Haskell.
  <h2>
    Project Euler
  <p>
    <a href="http://projecteuler.net">
      Project Euler
    \is a series of mathematic challenges that cannot be solved  without the use of programming skills. 
    You will need to register for Project Euler to submit your answers and have your name added to the list of people who have finished those problems.
  <h2>
    Haskell
  <p>
    <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell">
      Haskell 
    \ is a general-purpose, purely-functional programming language.  
    It was developed by a team of Mathematicians and Computer Scientists in order to look and act as much like math as possible. 
    Becuase of this there is no better language to solve Project Euler problems than Haskell.
